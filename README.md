# DRedis
This project aims at reimplementing Redis (https://redis.io/) by D language (https://dlang.org/), but not limited to it: 
1) extensively refer to any awsome design or technology from other SQL/NoSQL/NewSQL to provide a next generation
   in-memory database for Cloud computing 
2) leveraging  modern compiler framework like LLVM (http://www.llvm.org/) for further optimization and tooling
3) embrace Coroutine (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coroutine) driven design and architecture
